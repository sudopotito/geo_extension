**Enhancing the Address Experience in Frappe**
</div>

## Geo Extension

Geo Extension is a lightweight Frappe app that enhances the default Geo module by improving how users encode and manage address information. It extends the Address Doctype to make primary address keys (like State, City, and County) filterable and interactive â€” turning tedious address input into a smooth, guided process.

With country-specific manifests and hierarchical data levels, users can select from real administrative divisions instead of typing free-form text, drastically reducing data entry errors.

### Motivation

Encoding addresses in ERPNext or any Frappe app can be repetitive and error-prone â€” especially for data-heavy workflows like customer registration, delivery setup, or supplier profiling.
I built Geo Extension to simplify this process by making address encoding filtered, intuitive, and contextual.

This project was also a personal challenge: to build something useful and shareable with the Frappe Community, demonstrating how modular extensions can improve user experience within the framework.

### Key Features

Core â€” the file manager

Dynamic Address Hierarchy
- Automatically adapts field labels and filters (e.g., Province â†’ City â†’ Barangay) based on the selected countryâ€™s configuration.

Manifest-Driven Location Levels
- Country-specific manifest.json files define how address hierarchies load and map to Frappe fields.

Autocomplete Field Enhancement
- Converts static Data fields like state, city, and barangay into Autocomplete fields for faster, error-free entry.

Flexible Fallback Behavior
- If no manifest exists for the selected country, the app gracefully falls back to standard Data input â€” keeping the form usable by default.

Reference Data Support
- Supports location datasets in CSV format with hierarchical linkage across levels (Province â†’ City â†’ Barangay).

Seamless Integration
- Works directly with the existing Frappe Address Doctype â€” no new doctypes or dependencies required.

## Production setup

### Managed Hosting

You can try [Frappe Cloud](https://frappecloud.com), a simple, user-friendly and sophisticated [open-source](https://github.com/frappe/press) platform to host Frappe applications.

It takes care of installation, setup, upgrades, monitoring, maintenance and support of your Frappe deployments. It is a fully featured developer platform with an ability to manage and control multiple Frappe deployments.

### Self hosting

Follow these steps to set up Frappe Drive in production:

**Step 1**: Download the easy install script

```bash
wget https://frappe.io/easy-install.py
```

**Step 2**: Run the deployment command

```bash
python3 ./easy-install.py deploy \
    --project=drive_prod_setup \
    --email=email@example.com \
    --image=ghcr.io/frappe/drive \
    --version=stable \
    --app=drive \
    --sitename subdomain.domain.tld
```

Replace the following parameters with your values:

- `email@example.com`: Your email address
- `subdomain.domain.tld`: Your domain name where Drive will be hosted

The script will set up a production-ready instance of Frappe Drive with all the necessary configurations.

### Installation

To set up the repository locally, follow the steps mentioned below:

## Development Setup

### Docker

The quickest way to set up Frappe Drive and take it for a test _drive_.

Frappe framework is multi-tenant and supports multiple apps by default. This docker compose is just a standalone version with Frappe Drive pre-installed. Just put it behind your desired reverse-proxy if needed, and you're good to go.

If you wish to use multiple Frappe apps or need multi-tenancy. I suggest moving over to our production ready self-hosted workflow, or join us on Frappe Cloud to get first party support and hassle-free hosting.

**Step 1**: Setup folder and download the required files

```
mkdir frappe-drive
cd frappe-drive
```

**Step 2**: Download the required files

Docker Compose File:

```
wget -O docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/drive/main/docker/docker-compose.yml
```

Frappe Drive Bench Setup Script

```
wget -O init.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/frappe/drive/main/docker/init.sh
```

**Step 3**: Run the container and daemonize it

```
docker compose up -d
```

### Bare Metal

Install bench and set up a `frappe-bench` directory by following the [installation steps](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation).

**Step 1**: [Install Bench.](https://frappeframework.com/docs/user/en/installation)

**Step 2**: Provided bench is all set up you can proceed to install Frappe Drive

```sh
bench get-app drive --branch main
```

**Step 3**: Install some Drive specific system packages

Ubuntu/Debian (apt based distros)

```sh
sudo apt install ffmpeg libmagic
```

MacOs

```sh
brew install libmagic ffmpeg
```

**Step 4**: Install drive once it's downloaded

```
bench install-app drive
```

**Step 5**: Start bench if it's not already running

```
bench start
```

Frappe Drive should be accessible at `localhost:8000` or `sitename:8000`

## Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community!
If your country is not yet supported, you can easily help extend the list.

Hereâ€™s how:

Fork the repository.

Create a new folder in geo_extension/geo_extension/locations/data/<country_code>

Add your countryâ€™s location data as CSV files (level1.csv, level2.csv, level3.csv, etc.)

Create a manifest.json describing the hierarchy and mapping to Frappe fields.

Include metadata like:

author, version, description, source

Submit a pull request and briefly describe your countryâ€™s hierarchy (e.g., Province â†’ City â†’ District).

Your contribution helps users around the world encode addresses accurately and intuitively â€” and makes the Frappe ecosystem even more global.

### Community

Contributions, suggestions, and discussions are always welcome.
Feel free to fork, explore, or share improvements that make address data entry even more intuitive.

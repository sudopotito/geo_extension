## Overview

**Geo Extension** is a lightweight **Frappe app** that enhances the frappe Geo module by improving how users encode and manage address information.  
It extends the **Address Doctype** to make primary address keys (like _State, City, and County_) filterable and interactive â€” turning tedious address input into a smooth, guided process.

With country-specific manifests and hierarchical data levels, users can select from real administrative divisions instead of typing free-form text, drastically reducing data entry errors.

---

## Motivation

Encoding addresses in ERPNext or any Frappe app can be repetitive and error-prone â€” especially for data-heavy workflows like customer registration, delivery setup, or supplier profiling.  
**Geo Extension** simplifies this process by making address encoding filtered, intuitive, and contextual.

This project was also a personal challenge: to build something useful and shareable with the **Frappe Community**, demonstrating how modular extensions can improve user experience within the framework.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Address Hierarchy**  
  Automatically adapts field labels and filters (e.g., _Province â†’ City â†’ Barangay_) based on the selected countryâ€™s configuration.

- **Manifest-Driven Location Levels**  
  Country-specific `manifest.json` files define how address hierarchies load and map to Frappe fields.

- **Autocomplete Field Enhancement**  
  Converts static _Data_ fields (like state, city, and barangay) into **Autocomplete fields** for faster, error-free entry.

- **Flexible Fallback Behavior**  
  If no manifest exists for the selected country, the app gracefully falls back to standard Data input â€” keeping the form usable by default.

- **Reference Data Support**  
  Supports location datasets in CSV format with hierarchical linkage across levels (_Province â†’ City â†’ Barangay_).

- **Seamless Integration**  
  Works directly with the existing **Frappe Address Doctype** â€” no new doctypes or dependencies required.

### Self-Hosting

Follow these steps to set up **Geo Extension** in production:

#### Step 1: Download the easy install script

```bash
wget https://frappe.io/easy-install.py
```

#### Step 2: Run the deployment command

```bash
python3 ./easy-install.py deploy \
    --project=geo_extension_prod_setup \
    --email=your_email.example.com \
    --image=ghcr.io/sudopotito/geo_extension\
    --version=stable \
    --app=geo_extension \
    --sitename subdomain.domain.tld
```

Replace the following parameters with your own:

- `your_email.example.com`: Your email address
- `subdomain.domain.tld`: Your target domain

The script will spin up a production-ready instance of Geo Extension with all configurations.
